-1. look at the text!

0. twisstntern -- get rid of logging information twice -- no idea how!!!
                - add topology axis vhoice into the parser -- DONE!! :)
                - a comprehensice cli test!! DONE
                - create a logger which outputs to the Results file -- DONE!

1. Consider wether the (supposedly) optimized batch code for the  ts_to_twisst_weights
    in the ts_processing versus tree_processing really makes a difference.
    see the debugs.py code 
    DECIDE ON 1 STRATEGY AND APPLY IN BOTH --- DONE: conclusion- batch is fake news

    

2. Finish twisstntern_simulate - the version with the yaml config template
                               - how to add parsing form the command line- hydra? ask Sanketh
                               - add topology reordering option-- to the parer also
                               - add override option to the parser
                               - a comprehensice CLI test

                              
URGENT- compare the two ways of saving the locus mode- compare the simulate- 
to running over the two saved trees with the usual twisstNtern!!! -- come back to it!
--DONE -option 1 (not dasha) is best

3. write a script that compares two toplogy weights distributions like the pic that Sean sent to DIscord

4. write a script for hypothesis.compare -- for all 4 of our metrics!

5. write a pics_for_article.py visualization script and or a place where it is easy to experiment with plotting functions

6. start thinking about visualizations for 5 populations! - poke Dasha for the data

7. for fun write an alg. that figures out number of topologies for a number of populations (leaves) - rooted and unrooted

8.(?) combining topologies in edges- plotting simplex of the next dimenstion- visualization considerations

9. benchmarkings?
