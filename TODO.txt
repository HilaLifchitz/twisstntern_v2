missions for today and tmr

- check that twisstntern yes understands the first line as topologies-
(not super important)

- finish the visualization: 1- color scheme prepared
                            0 - add the empty subtriangle script from dasha
                            2 - now the same for the subtriangles populations
                            3 - plot function- play about

                            meanwhile everything just on twisstntern

  add the --downsample N+index thingy at both

figure out the wasserstein distnace- seperate script
do the data_copmare option - residuals
produce the examples compare again

3. write a script that compares two toplogy weights distributions like the pic that Sean sent to DIscord

4. write a script for hypothesis.compare -- for all 4 of our metrics!

5. write a pics_for_article.py visualization script and or a place where it is easy to experiment with plotting functions

6. start thinking about visualizations for 5 populations! - poke Dasha for the data


8.(?) combining topologies in edges- plotting simplex of the next dimenstion- visualization considerations

9. benchmarkings?
